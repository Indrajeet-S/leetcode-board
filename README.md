<h1 align="center">Leetcode Board</h1>
 LeetCode Board is a web application designed to help users keep track of their progress on LeetCode challenges and visualize their problem-solving journey. This project is perfect for developers preparing for technical interviews or anyone aiming to improve their coding skills through structured practice.
  
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). USER AUTHENTICATION is under development.

## Getting Started

Prerequisites

1. Install Node.js
Node.js is required to run JavaScript code on the server side. Download and install it from the official website, or if you’re using a package manager, use one of the following commands:<br>

 • macOS (with Homebrew):<br>
```
brew install node
```
 • Windows (with Chocolatey):
```
choco install nodejs
```
2. Package Manager
You can use npm, yarn, or pnpm to manage dependencies for the project. If Node.js is already installed, npm is included. You may also choose to install Yarn or pnpm:<br>

• Yarn:
```
npm install --global yarn
```
• pnpm:
```
npm install --global pnpm
```
## Project Setup

1. Clone the Repository
Use Git to clone the repository to your local machine. Replace your-username and your-repo with the actual GitHub username and repository name:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```
2. Navigate into the Project Directory
Move into the project directory to prepare for further setup:
```
cd your-repo
```
3. Install Project Dependencies
To install dependencies, use one of the following commands depending on your package manager:
```
npm install
or
yarn install
or
pnpm install
```
This will install all packages listed in package.json, which are necessary to run the application.

## Running the Development Server
Now that dependencies are installed, start the development server:
```
npm run dev
or
yarn dev
or
pnpm dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
